A month or two ago, I started working on a new startup called "Ikiform." It's an AI-native, open-source alternative to Google Forms.

Why I built this?

Well, if you've watched my previous videos, you know that I run a web design agency too. I rebranded my agency, and I thought it would be a good idea to add an inquiry form directly to the website.

However, matching my website's design and aesthetics, Google Forms was too unprofessional for me. As for other options, like Typeform, it was too expensive, considering the amount of inquiries I was getting.

So, that's why I built my own simple forms. When I published them, people asked me what forms these were and stuff like that. It attracted quite a lot of users, and many people booked a call. It almost doubled my leads and conversion rate.

So, I decided to create a professional and production-ready app for forms and called it an AI-native Google Forms alternative.

It took me a while to figure out how I wanted things to work and how users would love to use my forms app.

In just a month, I finished working on Ikiform and launched it on Twitter with a funny launch video.

The launch went smoothly, with many new signups and demo users, and the cherry on top was that we also made a few sales!

I followed Marc's advice and tried to share a simple and short story on Y Combinator News.

And for the first time, it blew up. I got a crazy ton of readers, a ton of upvotes, and so many comments.

I never thought that my post, which I literally took 2 minutes to write, would blow up like this, and within just 24 hours, it got me 8,000 visitors on the Ikiform website and a few more sales!

Although it was really nice to see new signups, new sales, traffic, and everything, readers still criticized me on Y Combinator.

But as they say, criticism is good, so I took it in a good way. I read every single comment and implemented all the improvements and changes.

So, that's the story of how I got 10,000+ visitors in just 24 hours after launching on Y Combinator News.
