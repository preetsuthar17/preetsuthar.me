## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` file helps artificial intelligence (AI) systems better understand your website by providing a clear outline of your site's structure and content, typically using Markdown syntax. It lists important page URLs and describes their content, making it easier for AI to interpret your site.

Having an accurate `llms.txt` is importantâ€”without it, AI tools may struggle to navigate your website or recognize the relationships between different pages. This can decrease your site's visibility in AI-driven search results.

While `llms.txt` is similar to `robots.txt` in that both assist web crawlers, they serve distinct roles. `robots.txt` controls crawler access, whereas `llms.txt` focuses on describing your site's content for AI understanding.

## How to Create & Generate Content for llms.txt

The first step is to create a new file named `llms.txt` in the root directory of your website.

To generate content for `llms.txt`, simply head over to [https://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/](https://llmstxt.firecrawl.dev/).
