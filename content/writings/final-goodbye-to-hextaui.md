It’s time.

I think I might stop working on [@HextaUI](https://hextaui.com)

Why?

Well, it’s been almost 4 years of building multiple variants and design systems for HextaUI. Honestly, there are already thousands of better libraries out there that you can use.

HextaUI started as a personal project that unexpectedly took off in the community. But with technologies evolving so quickly, maintaining everything by myself has become far too time-consuming. On top of that, I don’t have the budget to keep supporting it, lol.

I’m not going to delete it completely from the internet but I will be working on it a lot less moving forward.

Sometimes, to move forward, we have to let go.

Thanks to everyone who supported me because of that I was able to build and maintain HextaUI for almost 4 years because of you!

Signing off for now. Much love. ❤️
