You don’t need to be a genius. You just need to keep going.

Here’s the simple, no-fluff way to get your first 100 users:

1. **Launch everywhere** – Product Hunt, DevHunt, BetaList, Peerlist, AppSumo, Indie Hackers, Dailypings. If a site lets you list your product, put it there.
2. **Post on social daily** – One post won’t do much. Show up every day for 100 days. Study what works, adjust, and keep going.
3. **Watch your competitors** – See where they’re listed. Add your product to those same places. Do it by hand or use a tool.
4. **Use AI + SEO** – Create blog posts with ChatGPT. A set of 50 well-made posts can drive serious traffic. Aim for a domain rating of 15 or more.
5. **Run ads** – Try X, Google, Facebook, even Bing. Test and improve once, then let them run.
6. **Cold DMs and replies** – Find your audience. Keep it short and useful. One sentence pitch. Be helpful, not spammy.

The internet rewards persistence. No tricks. Just steady, consistent work. First 100 users, then 1000.
