A few years ago, when I was working as a freelance web developer, there were many projects that used repetitive layouts and designs.

That's when I built my own collection of basic UI components, such as buttons and others. At that time, I was using CSS, so I styled my components using CSS. Later, I decided to open-source these components, and that's when I created HextaUI.

After a few months, I found out about Tailwind CSS, so I decided to recreate all components with better design, modularity, and accessibility. This time, I also added animated components, not just base components. After building and launching, I left it and went on a break. (It didn't get any response because I didn't know marketing.)

Two months ago, I decided to rebuild the entire projectâ€”but this time, I wanted to scale it and make it stand out, because there's a lot of competition. So I rebuilt all base components, made them the latest versions, and gave it my all.

This time, it got a great response, in fact, it crossed 50,000 visitors in just 72 hours.

Looking at the response and demand, I created pre-built blocks using the base components and launched them at a minimal price. That also blew up and crossed more than 10 sales and exceeded $500 in revenue in just 24 hours. I was selling pre-built website blocks and UI components.

What I learned: the product matters the most. No matter how many competitors are out there, people still buy good products. If you think, "People are already building what I'm building," or "There are better options," then build something better. Make something specific. Niche down within that same niche.

Just build it.
