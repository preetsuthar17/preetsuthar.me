Animations are pretty cool, aren't they? yes, they are, but you might think adding
animations to the website is complex and challenging. But what if I say you can add
some pretty cool animation using CSS?

## Let's get started

We can add animation to our website using CSS `@keyframes` it's just as easy as writing normal CSS. In CSS using the `animation` property we can add some basic animations to Div or to any text.

## Syntax

We can use the `animation` property in CSS.

```css
.container {
  animation: time identifier animation_style;
}

@keyframes identifier {
  /* Keyframes */
}
```

You see in CSS we can add animation frame by frame which is pretty cool and you can do so much just with `@keyframes` in CSS. Let's see an example.

## Example

Let's assume we have div in html with class `container`.

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```

Here we are trying to create animation that automatically changes color frame by frame.

Let's write our CSS now!

```css
.container {
  background-color: red;
  animation: 3s changeColor infinite;
}

@keyframes changeColor {
  0% {
    background-color: red;
  }
  50% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  70% {
    background-color: green;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

## Explaination

Let's understand the code a bit more. Here we had a div with a class name of `container` we used `.continer` in the CSS file to target the specific.

Now to the div, we added the CSS `animation` property,

```
animation: 3s changeColor infinite;
```

And after adding the animation property we added `@keyframes` to animate the div.
Let's understand `@keyframes`.

In CSS `@keyframes` are used to give animation to the `animation` property. For the `@keyframes` identifier we use the same identifier we added in the `animation` property in CSS

```
animation: 3s changeColor infinite;

@keyframes changeColor{
  /**Same name as identifier in animation property. */
}
```

Let's divide the `@keyframes`

```
@keyframes changeColor {
  0% {
    background-color: red;
  }
  50% {`
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  70% {
    background-color: green;
  }
  100% {
    background-color: red;
  }
```

Now as you can we provided some frames like `0%`, `10%` etc. Now it represents the framing of animation. Here what I mean is when animation just started the frame will be `0%` when animation is finished half the frames will be `50%` when animation is finished the frames will be `100%`.

So basically in this block of `@keyframes` code, we added some frames like when the animation frame is `0%` background-color of `.container` will be red. just like that, we change the color according to the frames.

When the animation is running it will look something like this,

So yeah that's the most basic of `@keyframes` and CSS animations.

## Animation Delay property

CSS animation has some more properties like,

`animation-delay`: The value/Time provided in this property will delay the animation by that value/time

> If we add `animation-delay: 1s;` then the animation will run after `1 second`

So yeah CSS animation still has more properties to learn but we'll end this basics article here. Thank you for reading!
