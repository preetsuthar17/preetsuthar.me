            Launched my 11th SaaS called "ContraFast" which allows freelancers
            to create a contract between themselves and their clients. It's a
            simple solution to avoid scams and future disputes from clients.

            I'm learning more about SaaS and Startups. Trying to launch Startups
            as fast as possible to avoid burnout.

            I want to become a full-time SaaS creator and achieve a milestone of
            $10k MRR with SaaS products only.
