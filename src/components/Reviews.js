            Preet is one of the most friendliest person I know around and
            undoubtedly one of the most enthusiastic programmers I've seen in
            the tech community. I just can't rant enough about how generous and
            helpful he is. Love him.

            Preet was really quick to complete a commission, even though he had
            to go out for a couple of days. He really crunched everything into a
            few days, thus making him quicker than other website commissions
            I've had.
